Hi!

My name is Harry. I'm a software engineer from the UK with about fifteen years of experience, developing mainly in .NET technologies. These days my primary interests are CI/CD, testing and observability.

I help organise my local dotnet meetup: [http://brightonalt.net/](http://brightonalt.net/).

I also occasionally volunteer at my local [codebar](https://codebar.io/brighton).

This is my blog where I plan to share the things I've learned, either recently or in the past.

All the code in this blog will be made available on [my github page](https://github.com/IrrelevantElephant)
